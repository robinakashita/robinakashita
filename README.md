## Hello! My name is Robin Nakashita. 👋

I am an applied math and physics graduate interested in Earth system science, climate dynamics, and data-driven policy. I enjoy building tools that connect scientific modeling with real-world environmental questions.

- 🎓 B.S. Applied Mathematics & B.A. Physics — California State University, Long Beach (CSULB)
- 🌎 Interests: extreme weather, paleoclimate, monsoon dynamics, physics–AI models, nonlinear dynamics, glaciology
- 🛠️ Tools: Python (NumPy, pandas, xarray, matplotlib, cartopy), Jupyter, QGIS, Git, LaTeX
